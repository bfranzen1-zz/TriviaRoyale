# Overview

Trivia Roulette is an application that lets users play trivia games with others in a format similar to popular battle royale games. 


# Who?

	The specific target audience for this project are those that heavily enjoy trivia games, who are also looking to both show off and advance their knowledge in specific areas. We envision that those who want to put their knowledge to the test by competing against others in a fast-paced and challenging setting would be the ones most likely to use our application.


# Why?

Despite the massive player base of Battle Royale video games, they are still missing the market of those that simply do not enjoy video games. Because the desire to compete and receive the satisfaction of being number one out of a large group of people is not solely found in people who enjoy video games, people would want to use our application to get that outlet they can't find elsewhere. If you are someone who enjoys trivia, whether it be by watching game shows or partaking in it themselves, or even just want to be able to show off how smart you are, you would be given the opportunity to measure your skills against others while also improving your own knowledge. 

As developers, this application is not only an opportunity to show off our skill set learned during the course but to also push the boundaries of our understanding of concepts. We hope that it will also introduce us to new technologies and services to broaden the scope of our knowledge as well. Most of all, we wanted to build a fun and engaging application to share with others.

# Endpoints

The trivia microservice will handle the state of the game. The state will include a list of questions to ask and the users currently in the game. The service will generate a set of questions to ask users based on the API we are pulling from. After each question is answered by users in the alloted time those that didn't answer correctly will be removed from the game. 

POST /v1/users



*   Given a json object containing user information, including email, password, first name, last name, user name, and a photoURL, inserts the user into the user store
*   Returns the newly inserted user, along with their ID
*   Creates a session for the newly inserted user in the session store

GET /v1/users/{userID}



*   Given a userID, will return the user name and statistics for that specific userID 

POST /v1/user/{userID}



*   Adds user game statistics to UserStatistics table after a game has been completed

POST /v1/trivia



*   Insert a new trivia game into the trivia microservice

POST /v1/trivia/{triviaID}



*   Add user to lobby
    *   Upgrade to websocket to send questions
*   Start game if time runs out on lobby waiting

GET /v1/trivia/{triviaID}/answer



*   User sends answer to question
*   Game state updated
*   If answer incorrect user removed from state
*   Send user result of answer

POST /v1/trivia/{triviaID}/messages



*   Inserts the message body and the creator of the message into the messaging microservice

GET /v1/trivia/{triviaID}/message



*   Returns all messages for the request trivia game, along with their creators

We will also utilize the API endpoints we defined in assignments throughout the quarter for signing users up, storing session information for active users, and sending/receiving messages.
